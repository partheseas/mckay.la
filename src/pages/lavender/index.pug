		h1 A Game Boy Advance emulator that runs in your browser. ðŸŽ®
		p.
			It is written in Rust and compiles to WebAssembly, with a graphics backend
			that is powered by WebGL.
		p.
			In laymans terms, this means that it can run on
			essentially any device with a modern browser, and is performant and
			efficient enough to even run on smart phones with only minimal power draw.
		p.
			Upload your ROMs to sync them (and your game saves) between all of the
			devices that you want to use Lavender on.

		h3 The book
		p.
			Along with the available source code, I also wrote a book about the
			internals of the Game Boy Advance and how to emulate it. It covers an
			exciting range of topics, such as...

		ul.book-contents
			li Technical Specifications
			li CPU Architecture
			li Instruction encoding
			li Memory Layout
			li BIOS: What you should know
			li ROM file layouts
			li Interacting with the outside world
			ul
				li IO Registers and CPU interupts
				li VRAM, Palette, and Object details
			li How cartridge save files work
			li Testing your emulator for accuracy

		h3 The code
		p.
			The emulator is open source and available as a reference implementation
			for those who want an easy to understand code base to read through while
			they build their own emulator.

		ul.book-contents
			li No magic header files
			li No nasty abbreviated constant names
			li No magical pointer nonsense
			li Names should be descriptive and memorable
			li Lots of inline comments
