		p.
			Observatory is a modern cross-platform disk usage analyzer.
			It utilizes a radial sunburst graph to make it painless and simple to piece
			together exactly what is taking up space on your computer.

		p.
			Your hard drive is probably full of old files that you don't need
			anymore, which are taking up precious space.
			Observatory can help you locate these files by giving you a clear
			view of where the files are and how much space they are taking up.
