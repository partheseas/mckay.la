      h2 Full stack <strong style="color: #2f6c1c">Node.js</strong> + <strong style="color: #38b8e6">React</strong>
      p.
        Full stack web development is definitely my area of expertise. I began
        teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over 8 years ago and have
        continued working with them and many other technologies in a more
        professional manner for over 5 years.
      p.
        I'm familiar with various things such as Sass, Express, React, React&nbsp;Router,
        styled-components, RxJS, Vue, SSR, MongoDB, Parcel, Rollup, Babel,
        TypeScript, CI, Unit Testing and more.

    div
      h2 <strong style="color: #9feaf9">Electron</strong> and <strong style="color: #38b8e6">React Native</strong>
      p.
        The use of web technologies in Electron and React Native allows me to
        iterate quickly and produce high quality native applications across all
        major platforms.
      p.
        I've built apps using both platforms and I'm familiar with the tooling
        surrounding them, such as Electron Forge, Electron Builder,
        Nucleus, Expo and React Native Navigation.
    
    div
      h2 <strong style="color: #8e5030">Rust</strong> and <strong style="color: #654ff0">WebAssembly</strong>
      p.
        I love using Rust and WebAssembly. Rust is honestly just more pleasant
        to work with than most other systems programming languages, and strikes
        a great balance of providing high level abstractions and tooling, while
        also giving you powerful low level control of your program.
      p.
        The performance of WebAssembly combined with the portability of the web
        make it a very powerful tool, and I would love an opportunity to be
        able to use it more.
