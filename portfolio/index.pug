  //-     p.
  //-       Front end web development is definitely my area of expertise. My favorite
  //-       stack is Parcel, TypeScript, React, Sass, and styled-components, but I
  //-       do have some experience with a much wider array as well.
  //-     p.
  //-       In addition to traditional web development, I'm also familiar with using
  //-       Electron, Forge, and Nucleus to develop desktop applications for things
  //-       that require being a bit closer to hardware.
    
  //-   div
  //-     h2 <strong style="color: #8e5030">Rust</strong> and <strong style="color: #654ff0">WebAssembly</strong>
  //-     p.
  //-       Using WebAssembly lets you make performant and complex web applications
  //-       that simply weren't possible before. Safety, speed, and portability are
  //-       a powerful trio that make Rust and WebAssembly a great combination for
  //-       building complex and fast web applications.
  //-     p.
  //-       The combination of first class tooling and the amazing community have
  //-       quickly made Rust a favorite of mine. Particularly the quality of support
  //-       when working with WebAssembly makes it stand out among the crowd.

  //-     p.
  //-       Networking was the emphasis of my B.S. degree at Utah Valley University.
  //-       I've always thought that the most interesting thing computers are capable
  //-       of doing is talking to each other, and this age of the internet only
  //-       continues to prove that more and more true.
  //-     p.
  //-       I also find myself quite interested in AI and ML lately, which is in no
  //-       small part due to working at a company that I feel has a very practical
  //-       and interesting use case for it.
