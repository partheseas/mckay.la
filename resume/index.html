      <h3>Utah Valley University</h3>
      <h4>Computer Science, Networking<span class="date">January 2018 to April 2021, Current Student</span></h4>
      <p>I'm currently about half way through the Bachelor of Computer
        Science program at UVU.<!-- and have always been fascinated by computers. When
        I was in 7th grade I taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and by the
        end of high school I was contributing to open source projects on GitHub.
        I've been using Node.js since the 0.4.x branch when it was still just
        Ryan Dahl's side project. I remember when they still used the old cloud
        logo and I know the API like the back of my hand. More recently I've
        also learned Python and C++.--></p>

      <p>I was responsible for scheduling installation appointments,

      <p>I played a key role in the training and development of all of

        I was responsible for management of inventory and financial security,
        as well as oversight of the stores general operations. My store won
        several awards during my time there and I was often called upon to
        travel the other stores that were considered "problem children" by the
        company for periods of several weeks to resolve issues and give instruction
        for the management and crew to prevent further issues.</p>
